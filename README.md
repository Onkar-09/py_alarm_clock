The Python Alarm Clock project is a simple yet versatile application built using Python. This project provides users with a customizable alarm clock system, allowing them to set alarms.

In this programm we made a alarm clock with timer(i.e alarm rings when desirable time is up , which is to be set by users )

In addition to offering users a customizable alarm clock system, the Python Alarm Clock project includes a timer feature. Users can set desired times for the alarm to ring, providing flexibility for various scheduling needs. Moreover, the application displays the remaining time until the alarm rings, enhancing user awareness and convenience. With this added functionality, users can not only schedule alarms but also utilize timers for specific tasks, ensuring timely reminders and effective time management. This feature enriches the versatility of the application, catering to a wider range of user preferences and requirements in managing their daily routines.
